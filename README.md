# goa-ai-data-reports (in progress)

## Overview
GOA and AI data reports summarize data from the trawl survey each year. These reports provide detailed survey summaries for a technical audience. This code is adapted from Emily Markowitz's [framework](https://github.com/EmilyMarkowitz-NOAA/gap_bs_data_report) for Eastern Bering Sea data reports. The scripts in this repo pull text from [Google Docs](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UAQKChSuKohsRJ5enOloHPk3qFtk5kVC), turn them into Markdown files, and knit a report in .docx format summarizing survey data and some basic summary information. This is a little change.

### Structure
The main report sections are:

- Preface (boilerplate)
- Abstract
- Introduction
- Methods (boilerplate)
- Results
- Flatfishes
- Roundfishes
- Rockfishes
- Skates
- Miscellaneous Species
- Citations
- Appendix A: strata Specifications and Locations (BP, until survey redesign ~2023)
- Appendix B: Fish and invertebrate taxa encountered (BP)
- Appendix C: Length-weight relationships
- Appendix D: Bottom temperatures and surface temperatures


### Tables
#### Region (all species)
  * Number of stations allocated, attempted, and successfully completed with sampling
density for the **[Year, Region]** bottom trawl survey by survey district and depth
interval.

  * Mean CPUE (kg/ha) for the 20 most abundant groundfish species in each survey district
during the **[Year, Region]** bottom trawl survey [Note: this caption SAYS groundfish but the species list includes octopus and skates for the AI]

#### Species group (i.e., flatfishes, roundfishes)
For each species group, the component tables are:

  * Catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE), biomass, relative (%) biomass, and cumulative abundance (%) of **[Group]** caught during the **[Year, Region]** bottom trawl survey combined across all survey districts

#### Species
For each species, the component tables are (all examples are from AI):

  *  Summary by survey districts and depth intervals of **[Year, Region]** trawl effort (number of trawl hauls), number of hauls containing **[Species]**, mean CPUE and biomass estimates with lower and upper 95% confidence limits (LCL and UCL, respectively), and average fish weight. 

  * Summary of **[Species]** mean catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) and estimated biomass (t) including the lower and upper 95% confidence limits (LCL and UCL, respectively) from the **[Year, Region]** bottom trawl survey by stratum (i.e., the composite of survey district, depth interval, and subarea) ordered from highest to lowest CPUE.

### Figures
#### Region (all species)
  * Map of the **[Region, Year]** bottom trawl survey area indicating survey districts 
     - This has a different caption for each region, because it describes each of the survey districts and abbrevs in the caption.

#### Species

For each species, the component figures are:

  * Distribution and relative abundance of **[Species]** from the **[Year, Region]** bottom trawl survey across the a) eastern, b) central, and c)western archipelago.

  * Population length composition of **[Species]** by survey district and depth interval in the **[Year, Region]** bottom trawl survey and number of fish measured.

## Existing documentation
There are instructions for creating the tables and figures for the GOA data report currently in `G:/AI-GOA/Instructions&Procedures/Data Report`. Our goal is to take these and turn them into a Markdown file with documentation.
