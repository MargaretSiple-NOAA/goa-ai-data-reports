# goa-ai-data-reports (in progress)

## Overview
GOA and AI data reports summarize data from the trawl survey each year. These reports provide detailed survey summaries for a technical audience. The scripts in this repo pull text from [Google Docs](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UAQKChSuKohsRJ5enOloHPk3qFtk5kVC), turn them into R Markdown files, and knit a report in .docx format summarizing survey data and some basic information about the survey. 

## General workflow
To create the full report: 

- start with `09_create_report_contents.R` and run the whole script. This builds the tables, figures, and in-text values used in the report.
- When you're ready to build the full report in .docx, check the `tabledate`, `figuredate`, and `reportvaluesdate` in `00_report_settings.R`, and run `10_knit_report.R`. This will produce one .docx for the body of the report, and will draw in appendices from their sources.
- A smidge of post-processing is needed in Word: check table widths, order of appendices, and the headers (in navigation pane) to confirm that the scripts have run and the report draft is ready.

### Structure

As of April 2023, the sections of the report are as follows:

- Preface - drawn straight from google drive
- Abstract - drawn straight from google drive
- Introduction - drawn straight from google drive
- Methods - drawn straight from google drive
- Results 
  - Results by Area - drawn straight from google drive
  - Results by Species - drawn from RMarkdown and mixed with text sentences ("Species blurbs") from google drive

- Citations
- Appendix A: strata specifications and locations
- Appendix B: Fish and invertebrate taxa encountered - produced with R code
- Appendix C: Length-weight relationships
- Appendix D: Bottom temperatures and surface temperatures

### A note about creating tables and figures
Tables "3" and "4" (CPUE and biomass by survey district and depth, and CPUE and biomass by INPFC area/stratum and depth, respectively) are currently generated outside this code by Paul, saved to the G Drive, and pulled from there in this code. In the future we want to automate these tables, but for the AI 2022 report this system worked pretty well and helped us share the workload.

### A note about using summary tables vs. straight tables from RACEBASE
This report uses biomass and CPUE summary tables from the AI schema. Another way to produce these tables is to start with the raw tables from RACEBASE and do the summarizing in R.

## Sources of the values in the species chapters:

| Value      | Source |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| INPFC area with highest and second-highest estimated biomass      | Summary tables generated by Paul       |
| INPFC area with largest average length   | Calculated from RACEBASE.SPECIMEN filtered to otolith collections and averaged by species and INPFC area        |
| Where biomass ranks relative to other species (e.g., "species X had the third largest biomass in the survey")   | From AI.BIOMASS_TOTAL table |

## Existing documentation
There are instructions for creating the tables and figures for the GOA data report currently in `G:/AI-GOA/Instructions&Procedures/Data Report`. Our goal is to take these and turn them into a Markdown file with documentation.
