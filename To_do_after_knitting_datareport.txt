Add to data reports once we have a finished Markdown output:

- Go through and quickly double-check the figures; make sure map figure is centered, etc.
- Find/replace "first most abundant species" or "1st most abundant species" - change to "most abundant species"
- Go through the chapters for the complexes and make sure they're grammatically correct! [grimace emoji]
- Check Appendix C for correct equation formatting and column widths
- Check page numbers and make sure intro pages have the special kind (i, ii, xi etc)
- Add TOC; make sure it's just called Contents
- Double check asterisk comments for NRS, kam/atf, and other complexes
- Add cover page 
- Make sure vessel names are italicized in bullet points
- Confirm that species names in TOC are italicized
- Make sure all table and figure captions are left-justified the way they're supposed to be in TMs and DPRs. Use the "table caption" formatting button in the Home tab of Word. I don't know why the figure captions automatically format and the table captions don't. Tooooo lazy to figure it out.
- See if you can get the two temperature figures on the same page
- Check/create hyperlinks to other sections -- e.g., citations to appendices should hyperlink internally to that appendix. 
- Make sure all table and figure captions are left-justified the way they're supposed to be in TMs and DPRs. Use the "table caption" formatting button in the Home tab of Word. I don't know why the figure captions automatically format and the table captions don't. Tooooo lazy to figure it out.
- Confirm that species names in TOC are italicized
- Make sure there aren't any errant blank pages
- Make sure northern and southern (RF/RS) are not capitalized when they are not starting a sentence. 
- Check for non-breaking spaces in text of intro, methods

- In the NRS/SRS section, make sure the wording makes sense and bullet #1 mentions that this complex does not include "unidentified rock sole": "Northern and southern rock sole includes northern rock sole (Lepidopsetta polyxystra), and southern rock sole (Lepidopsetta bilineata). It does not include unidentified rock sole."
- Also fix the rougheye-blackspotted summary. First bullet should say: "The rougheye - blackspotted rockfish complex includes rougheye rockfish (Sebastes aleutianus), blackspotted rockfish (Sebastes melanostictus), and unidentified rougheye and blackspotted rockfishes."
- LAST: Update the TOC in Word so that the page numbers and stuff are correct.
- LAST: Edit the abstract and make sure the language is right. 

# Jim advice from AI 2024 report:
Fix the section breaks between portrait and landscape pages. This will prevent lost pages.
Make sure the TOC is set up correctly so that page numbers and bookmarks update properly.
Double-check columns so headings in tables aren't split incorrectly.
Create a simpler Styles palette so it is easier to keep headings and body text straight.
Consider using consistent placement for figure and table captions so they don't appear to undulate when scrolling through pages. For example, anchor them at the 1" top or bottom margins.
