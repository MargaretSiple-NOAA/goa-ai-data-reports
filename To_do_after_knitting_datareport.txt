Add to data reports once we have a finished Markdown output:

- Go through and quickly double-check the figures; make sure map figure is centered, etc.
- Find/replace "first most abundant species" or "1st most abundant species" - change to "most abundant species"
- Add cover page 
- Go through the chapters for the complexes and make sure they're grammatically correct!
- See if you can get the two temperature figures on the same page
- Make sure vessel names are italicized in bullet points
- Check/create hyperlinks to other sections -- e.g., citations to appendices should hyperlink internally to that appendix. 
- Make sure all table and figure captions are left-justified the way they're supposed to be in TMs and DPRs. Use the "table caption" formatting button in the Home tab of Word. I don't know why the figure captions automatically format and the table captions don't. Tooooo lazy to figure it out.
- Add TOC; make sure it's just called Contents
- Confirm that species names in TOC are italicized
- Check Appendix C for correct equation formatting and column widths
- Make sure there aren't any errant blank pages
- Make sure northern and southern (RF/RS) are not capitalized when they are not starting a sentence. 
- In the NRS/SRS section, make sure the wording makes sense and bullet #1 mentions that this complex does not include "unidentified rock sole": "Northern and southern rock sole includes northern rock sole (Lepidopsetta polyxystra), and southern rock sole (Lepidopsetta bilineata). It does not include unidentified rock sole."
- Also fix the rougheye-blackspotted summary. First bullet should say: "The rougheye - blackspotted rockfish complex includes rougheye rockfish (Sebastes aleutianus), blackspotted rockfish (Sebastes melanostictus), and unidentified rougheye and blackspotted rockfishes."
- Add page numbers and make sure intro pages have the special kind
- LAST: Edit the abstract and make sure the language is right. 
- LAST: Update the TOC in Word so that the page numbers and stuff are correct.


DONE:
