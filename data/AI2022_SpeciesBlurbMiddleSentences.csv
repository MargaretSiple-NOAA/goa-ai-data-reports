sablefish,20510,
arrowtooth flounder,10110,"Arrowtooth flounder were caught throughout the survey area at all depths; however, the vast majority in the three Aleutian survey districts were caught at less than 300 m.  The highest densities were recorded in sub districts within the Eastern Aleutians and Southern Bering Sea survey districts in waters less than 300 m in depth.  Size consistently increased with depth in all survey districts. The length frequency distribution was bimodal for females but unimodal for males, and the range of lengths was substantially wider for females. "
atka mackerel,21921,"Although Atka mackerel were caught in all survey districts and at all survey depths, the vast majority were caught at depths less than 200 m in the three Aleutian survey districts.  The highest densities of this species occurred in the 101 - 200 m depth interval in one Eastern and one Central Aleutian subdistricts. Relatively high densities also occurred at depths between 101 and 200 m in one Western and another Eastern Aleutian sub district.  There was no discernable trend in size with depth.  Although the higher of the two length modes occurred at a slightly larger size for females (approximately 42 cm vs. 40 cm for males), the length distributions were relatively similar between the sexes.  "
Pacific cod,21720,"Pacific cod were caught at all depths throughout the survey area, but most were caught at depths shallower than 200 m.  The highest densities occurred at depths shallower than 200 m in various sub districts of all survey districts except the Central Aleutians.  The by far largest individual catch occurred near the west end of Seguam Island.  There was no trend in size with depth. Both males and females had similar bimodal length frequency distributions with a mode at approximately 50-55 cm.  "
Pacific ocean perch,30060,"The vast majority of Pacific ocean perch were caught at depths between 100 and 300 m in all survey districts.  The highest densities of this species occurred at depths between 200 and 300 m in various sub districts within all four of the survey districts, although the single highest concentration by far was in one sub district in the Western Aleutians.  Mean size generally increased with depth in the three Aleutian districts but not in the Southern Bering Sea district.  The range of the length distributions were similar for males and females, which were both unimodal with a mode at approximately 38 cm for both sexes."

rougheye rockfish,30051,"In 2006 it was determined that what had previously been identified as rougheye rockfish was actually two separate species, with the vast majority in the Aleutian Islands survey area being blackspotted rockfish.  The majority of rougheye rockfish were caught at depths between 101 and 200 m in the Southern Bering Sea as well as at depths between 301 and 500 m in the Eastern Aleutians and Southern Bering Sea survey districts.  The highest densities of this species occurred at depths between 101 and 200 m in one Southern Bering Sea sub district.  There was a general increase in size with depth.  The length frequency distributions, which were unimodal for both sexes, were relatively similar for males and females although the mode occurred at a slightly larger size for males (approximately 35 cm for males vs. approximately 30 cm for females).  In addition, the length frequency distribution for males was more positively skewed than the distribution for females. "
blackspotted rockfish,30052,"Blackspotted rockfish were caught in all survey districts and at all depths deeper than 100 m.  The highest densities by far occurred at depths between 301 and 500 m in one Eastern Aleutians subdistrict, while the largest catches were recorded off of Amchitka, Amlia, and Adak islands, as well as at Stalemate Bank.  There was no consistent trend in size with depth.  Males and females had similar and unimodal length distributions, with sizes ranging between approximately 16 cm and 50 cm. The bulk of recorded lengths were between 30 cm and 42 cm.   A pronounced mode occurred at approximately 30 cm for both males and females."
Northern rock sole,10261,"Almost all northern rock sole were caught at depths shallower than 200 m and were relatively abundant throughout the survey area.  The highest densities of this species occurred at depths shallower than 100 m in one Central Aleutian and one Western Aleutian sub district as well as at Petrel Bank.  There was a distinct trend of increasing size with depth to 300 m.  The length frequency distributions were unimodal for both males and females but the range of female lengths was larger as was the mode, which occurred at approximately 37 cm for females vs. approximately 32 cm for males."
