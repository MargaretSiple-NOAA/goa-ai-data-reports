yellow irish lord,21347,"Although yellow Irish lords were caught at all depths intervals and in all four survey districts, the vast majority were caught at depths shallower than 200 m in the Eastern and Central Aleutian survey districts. The highest densities occurred in the SE Eastern Aleutians subdistrict and in the Petrel Bank subdistrict in the Central Aleutians at depths less than 200 m. There is no clear trend in weight compared to depth. Male and female length distributions were generally unimodal where females had a distinct, symmetrical mode at approximately 38 cm and males had a negatively skewed mode around 41 cm. Females had a small, secondary mode at approximately 24 cm."
sablefish,20510,The vast majority of sablefish were caught at depths between 200 and 500 m in all survey districts. The highest densities of this species occurred at depths between 301-500 m in the Southern Bering Sea and between 200-300 m in the N Central Aleutians subdistrict. There was a small decline in fish weight compared to depth for all survey districts with the exception of the Southern Bering Sea survey area where fish weight increased with depth. Males and females had overlapping length frequencies with females having a more positively skewed distribution then males but having a similar mode approximately at 54 cm.
arrowtooth flounder,10110,"Arrowtooth flounder were caught throughout the survey area at all depths; however, the vast majority in the three Aleutian survey districts were caught at less than 300 m.  The highest densities were recorded in sub districts within the Eastern Aleutians and Southern Bering Sea survey districts in waters less than 300 m in depth.  Size consistently increased with depth in all survey districts. The length frequency distribution was bimodal for females but unimodal for males, and the range of lengths was substantially wider for females. "
atka mackerel,21921,"Although Atka mackerel were caught in all survey districts and at all survey depths, the vast majority were caught at depths less than 200 m in the three Aleutian survey districts.  The highest densities of this species occurred in the 101 - 200 m depth interval in one Eastern and one Central Aleutian subdistricts. Relatively high densities also occurred at depths between 101 and 200 m in one Western and another Eastern Aleutian sub district.  There was no discernable trend in size with depth.  Although the higher of the two length modes occurred at a slightly larger size for females (approximately 42 cm vs. 40 cm for males), the length distributions were relatively similar between the sexes.  "
Pacific cod,21720,"Pacific cod were caught at all depths throughout the survey area, but most were caught at depths shallower than 200 m.  The highest densities occurred at depths shallower than 200 m in various sub districts of all survey districts except the Central Aleutians.  The by far largest individual catch occurred near the west end of Seguam Island.  There was no trend in size with depth. Both males and females had similar bimodal length frequency distributions with a mode at approximately 50-55 cm.  "
Pacific ocean perch,30060,"The vast majority of Pacific ocean perch were caught at depths between 100 and 300 m in all survey districts.  The highest densities of this species occurred at depths between 200 and 300 m in various sub districts within all four of the survey districts, although the single highest concentration by far was in one sub district in the Western Aleutians.  Mean size generally increased with depth in the three Aleutian districts but not in the Southern Bering Sea district.  The range of the length distributions were similar for males and females, which were both unimodal with a mode at approximately 38 cm for both sexes."
walleye pollock,21740,"Walleye pollock were caught throughout the survey area and at all depths but high densities were encountered at all depths in the Southern Bering Sea, depths less than 100 m in the Eastern Aleutians and between 100-300 m in the Central and Western Aleutians survey districts. The highest density by far occurred in the W Southern Bering Sea between 100-200 m with a CPUE of 291.344 kg/ha. Males and females had relatively similar negatively skewed length distributions with a wide length range of 25-70 cm. There is a distinct mode for both sexes around 54 cm."
rougheye rockfish,30051,"In 2006 it was determined that what had previously been identified as rougheye rockfish was actually two separate species, with the vast majority in the Aleutian Islands survey area being blackspotted rockfish.  The majority of rougheye rockfish were caught at depths between 101 and 200 m in the Southern Bering Sea as well as at depths between 301 and 500 m in the Eastern Aleutians and Southern Bering Sea survey districts.  The highest densities of this species occurred at depths between 101 and 200 m in one Southern Bering Sea sub district.  There was a general increase in size with depth.  The length frequency distributions, which were unimodal for both sexes, were relatively similar for males and females although the mode occurred at a slightly larger size for males (approximately 35 cm for males vs. approximately 30 cm for females).  In addition, the length frequency distribution for males was more positively skewed than the distribution for females. "
blackspotted rockfish,30052,"Blackspotted rockfish were caught in all survey districts and at all depths deeper than 100 m.  The highest densities by far occurred at depths between 301 and 500 m in one Eastern Aleutians subdistrict, while the largest catches were recorded off of Amchitka, Amlia, and Adak islands, as well as at Stalemate Bank.  There was no consistent trend in size with depth.  Males and females had similar and unimodal length distributions, with sizes ranging between approximately 16 cm and 50 cm. The bulk of recorded lengths were between 30 cm and 42 cm.   A pronounced mode occurred at approximately 30 cm for both males and females."
Northern rock sole,10261,"Almost all northern rock sole were caught at depths shallower than 200 m and were relatively abundant throughout the survey area.  The highest densities of this species occurred at depths shallower than 100 m in one Central Aleutian and one Western Aleutian sub district as well as at Petrel Bank.  There was a distinct trend of increasing size with depth to 300 m.  The length frequency distributions were unimodal for both males and females but the range of female lengths was larger as was the mode, which occurred at approximately 37 cm for females vs. approximately 32 cm for males."
shortraker rockfish,30576,"Shortraker rockfish were almost exclusively caught at depths deeper than 200 m and were only encountered between 300 and 500 m in the Southern Bering Sea survey district. The highest density by far occurred at depths between 300 and 500 m in the SE Central Aleutians subdistrict with a CPUE of 145.998 kg/ha. The second highest CPUE was 16.524 kg/ha encountered in the N Central Aleutians subdistrict between 300 and 500 m. The length ranges were relatively wide for both males and females, with the bulk of lengths between approximately 30 cm and 60 cm and a poorly-defined mode at approximately 48 cm for females and 45 cm for males."
Aleutian skate,472,Aleutian skate were caught throughout the survey area and at all depths but were mostly encountered at depths between 100 and 200 m in the Western and Eastern Aleutians and shallower than 100 m in the Southern Bering Sea survey districts. Aleutian skate accounted for 7% of all the skate species encountered on the survey. The subdistricts with the highest density of this species occurred between 100 and 200 m in the SW Eastern Aleutians and E Southern Bering Sea as well as between 200 and 300 m in the E Western Aleutians. The distribution of length frequencies differed in male and female Aleutian skates but had a similar mode around 1100 mm. Female Aleutian skates also had two smaller modes around 500 and 1400 mm and males had a more negative skewed distribution with a second mode at 600 mm.
white blotched skate,480,"Although whiteblotched skates were caught throughout the survey area and at all depths, the vast majority were caught at depths between 100 and 200 m in the three Aleutian survey districts and primarily in the Eastern Aleutians survey district. The highest densities were recorded at depths between 100 and 200 in the NE Eastern Aleutians, W Western Aleutians and the SE Eastern Aleutian subdistricts. There was also a high density of whiteblotched skates encountered in the SE Eastern Aleutians in depths greater than 300 m. Male and female length frequencies share a similar bimodal distribution with a mode around 75 cm and 105 cm. This bimodal trend appears to be stronger in 2022 then past survey data years. "
kamchatka flounder,10112,"Kamchatka flounder were caught throughout the survey area and at all depths, but most were caught at depths between 200 and 500 m in all survey districts except in the Southern Bering Sea where the catch rate was extremely low except in the 300-500 m depth interval. Size generally increased with depth. The North Central Aleutians subdistrict (300–500 m) in the Central Aleutians survey district had a CPUE more than twice that of the subdistrict with the second highest subdistrict. Relatively high densities were also recorded at depths between 300 and 500 m in three subdistricts in the Eastern and Western Aleutian Islands survey districts as well as two slightly shallower subdisticts in the Central Aleutians. Length frequency plots for both males and females showed a distinct mode at around 35 cm which tapered sharply with increasing length to around 50 cm and then gradually out to 75 to 80 cm with females getting slightly larger. Males showed a slight mode at about 65 cm."
Southern rock sole,10262,"Although southern rock sole were caught in all survey districts and at all depths shallower than 200 m, the vast majority were caught at depths less than 100 m in the Southern Bering Sea and Eastern Aleutian districts. The subdistrict with the highest concentration of this species (the Eastern Southern Bering Sea subdistrict in the 1-100 m depth range) had an estimated biomass greater than all of the 18 other subdistricts combined. The length frequency distribution showed a significantly broader size range and much larger maximum size for females. Females had a mode at about 38 cm with a maximum length approaching 60 cm where males had a mode at around 34 cm and had a maximum length of less than 50 cm."
Pacific halibut,10120,Pacific halibut were caught in all depth ranges in the Southern Bering Sea and Eastern Aleutian Islands survey districts. In the Central Aleutian Islands survey district they were absent in the 200–300 m depth interval and in the Western Aleutian Islands none were encountered deeper than 200 m.  The highest densities occurred in subdistricts with depths less than 200 m in the Eastern Aleutian and Southern Bering Sea survey districts.  Size always increased with depth within each survey district and the largest average size was located in the Western Aleutian Islands area in the 100-200 m depth range. Length frequency data showed a mode around 60 cm for both males and females with females attaining a larger maximum size but males showing a larger proportion of fish bigger than 60 cm.
Greenland turbot,10115,"Although Greenland turbot were caught in all of the survey districts, they were extremely rare and only encountered in seven tows during the entire survey and only in depths greater than 200 m.  The highest density occurred in the Petrel Bank subdistrict in the 200-300 m depth range within the Central Aleutians survey district. The length frequency data showed a bimodal distribution for males only with modes at approximately 55 and 65 cm."
flathead sole,10130,"Although flathead sole were caught along the entire length of the survey as well as in all of the depth ranges, the vast majority were caught at depths less than 200 m in the Western Aleutians and Southern Bering Sea survey districts. There was no distinct correlation between depth and average weight. The highest densities of this species occurred in the Eastern Southern Bering Sea subdistrict in the 100-200m depth range. The density in this subdistrict was more than three times greater than the density in the next highest subdistrict. The length distribution showed a mode at about 35 cm for females and slightly smaller for males. Females also had a greater maximum size than males."
rex sole,10200,"Although rex sole were caught throughout the survey area and at all depths, most were caught at depths deeper than 100 m in the Eastern and Western Aleutians, and all depths in the Southern Bering Sea survey districts.  The highest densities occurred in three subdistricts within the Southern Bering Sea and Eastern Aleutian survey districts, all in different depth ranges: 101-200 m and 301-500 m in the Southern Bering Sea, and 201-300 m in the Eastern Aleutians . Females were consistently larger than males in all four survey districts with a mode occurring at 48 cm for females and 42 cm for males. "
giant grenadier,21230,"No giant grenadier were caught in the Southern Bering Sea survey district, and with the exception of four tows in the 201-300 m depth range, they were only caught at depths deeper than 300 m. The highest densities occurred at depths between 300 and 500 m in four subdistricts within the Central Aleutian survey district.  The largest catches were concentrated between Kiska and Kanaga Islands. Almost all recorded lengths were from females, which were vastly more abundant than males within the survey depth range.  The bulk of the length distribution ranged between approximately 27 cm and 35 cm, with a distinct mode at approximately 29 cm. Unlike all other species in this report whose length is either fork or total length, giant grenadier were measured from the tip of the snout to the insertion of the anal fin."
northern rockfish,30420,"Although northern rockfish were caught throughout the four survey areas and at all depths, the vast majority were caught at depths shallower than 200 m.  Large catches were not concentrated in any one area but the highest densities of this species were caught at depths shallower than 200 m in one Eastern Aleutian, one Southern Bering Sea and three Western Aleutian subdistricts. The length frequencies of northern rockfishes were unimodal and symmetrical in 2022 for males and females. The length ranges were similar for both sexes but females were generally larger with a distinct mode at approximately 36 cm versus 34 cm for males"
shortspine thornyhead,30020,"Almost all shortspine thornyhead were caught at depths deeper than 200 m in all survey districts except the Western Aleutians, where great numbers were also caught at depths between 100 and 200 m. The highest densities of this species occurred at depths between 200 and 500 m in three subdistricts within the Western Aleutians and Southern Bering Sea survey districts. Lengths collected in 2022 for shortspine thornyhead were not separated by sex for length frequencies but sex data was collected for otolith fish. The length distribution for the unsexed combined survey districts was relatively close to bell-shaped, with a mode at approximately 35 cm. A second and less pronounced mode occurred at approximately 18 cm. The length distribution for male and female shortspine thornyhead had a similar, more distinct mode around 35 cm and were positively skewed in distribution."
