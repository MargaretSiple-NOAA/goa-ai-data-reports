yellow irish lord,21347,"Yellow Irish lords were primarily caught at stations shallower than 300 m and were most abundant in the 100–200 m depth stratum of the Eastern AI. They were not particularly abundant in the Western AI. Across all survey districts there does not appear to be a strong trend in length with depth of capture. Female length distributions were consistently unimodal through time, with a median length of 37 cm in recent surveys. Male length distributions appear to be more variable and have had a greater median length since 2014 (median length 43 cm F.L. in 2022)."
sablefish,20510,"Sablefish were caught in all depth intervals sampled in the SBS, but did not occur in catches shallower than 100 m in the Aleutian districts. The highest CPUEs for this species occurred between 200 and 500 m throughout the survey area and the SBS had the highest CPUEs in this depth range compared to the other survey districts. There does not appear to be a consistent relationship between sablefish length and depth of capture across the survey area though it does appear that smaller individuals are found shallower in the SBS. Female and male length frequencies are similar through time. Over the three most recent Aleutian surveys since 2016, there has been a slight increase in median length in male sablefish (46 cm F.L. in 2016; 54 cm F.L. in 2022)."
arrowtooth flounder,10110,Confident identification and separation of arrowtooth flounder from its close congener Kamchatka flounder on Aleutian surveys began in 1994. Arrowtooth flounder were caught throughout the survey area and in all depth intervals. Their CPUE was higher at all depths sampled in the SBS compared to other survey districts though the highest arrowtooth flounder biomass estimate came from the Eastern AI. There is a consistent trend across survey districts of arrowtooth flounder length increasing with depth of capture. There do not appear to be any trends in the length frequency distributions over time: median lengths have remained relatively constant for a given sex over the survey period. The median length of females is higher than that of males (41 cm F.L. vs. 38 cm F.L.) and females achieve much larger maximum length than males.
atka mackerel,21921,Atka mackerel were most abundant in the Aleutian survey districts though they were caught in all survey districts and at nearly all survey depths. Their highest CPUEs were generally recorded in the 101–200 m depth interval with their highest biomass estimated in the Eastern and Western AI. The relationship of Atka mackerel length with depth suggests a length maximum at about 200 m capture depth. Female and male length frequency distributions have remained fairly consistent through the last 2 decades with no clear trend in median length for either sex.
Pacific cod,21720,"Pacific cod occurred throughout the survey districts at all depths with the exception of the 301–500 m depth interval in the Central AI. The highest Pacific cod CPUEs were recorded in the SBS and high CPUEs were consistently recorded shallower than 200 m in all districts. There appears to be a length maximum for Pacific cod caught between 101 and 200 m, but there is no clear trend of length with depth. Female and male length distributions have varied slightly over time in the Aleutian Islands survey area, oscillating around median lengths of 56 and 57 cm F.L., respectively."
Pacific ocean perch,30060,"Pacific ocean perch were caught in all depths and all districts of the Aleutian survey. They were most abundant in the Western AI at depths between 200 and 300 m and least abundant in the SBS. Pacific ocean perch length appears to increase with increasing depth up to around 250 m. Female and male length frequency distributions were primarily unimodal with a high degree of overlap in the length ranges between the sexes, centered around 36.5 cm. There does not appear to be a trend in median length during the time series."
walleye pollock,21740,"Walleye pollock occurred in trawl catches throughout the survey area and at all depths sampled. The highest pollock CPUE was recorded from the SBS between 100 and 200 m depths, while the highest biomass estimate for all depths combined came from the Eastern AI. Walleye pollock length increased with depth of capture across the survey area. Female and male length frequency distributions over time have changed over time and do not show a strong pattern over the course of the survey."
rougheye rockfish,30051,"The identification and separation of rougheye rockfish from its close congener blackspotted rockfish began on Aleutian surveys in 2006. Rougheye rockfish occur in very low numbers in Aleutian Islands survey trawl catches so it is difficult to confidently identify and interpret patterns in these data. They were more common in the SBS and Eastern AI than in other survey districts and they were collected in all depth intervals sampled in the SBS, but were only caught below 100 m depth in the Aleutian districts. Data were insufficient to draw a conclusion about the relationship between rougheye rockfish length and depth of capture. Expanded length frequencies suggest that males may achieve a larger maximum length than females in our samples and that the median length of both sexes are lower in 2022 than when we last sampled the region in 2018."
blackspotted rockfish,30052,"The identification and separation of blackspotted rockfish from its close congener rougheye rockfish began on Aleutian surveys in 2006. Blackspotted rockfish are somewhat more abundant in Aleutian Islands survey trawl catches than rougheye rockfish. They were caught in all survey districts, occurring primarily between depths of 100 and 300 m and were more abundant in the Aleutian districts than in SBS. The highest blackspotted rockfish CPUE occurred in the Eastern AI in 300–500 m with the highest total district biomass estimated for the Eastern AI as well. Blackspotted rockfish length increased with increasing depth of capture across all survey districts while length frequency distributions and median lengths remained fairly consistent within and across survey years."
Northern rock sole,10261,The identification and separation of northern rock sole from its close congener southern rock sole began on the 1997 Aleutian Islands survey. Northern rock sole occurred throughout the Aleutian survey area. They were commonly caught in water shallower than 300 m with the highest CPUE observed in the Central AI. Northern rock sole lengths increased with increasing depth of capture and females appear to grow longer than males (36 cm median F.L. for females; 30 cm for males). Female and male length modes were similar and consistent through time with no trend in median length over the survey years.
shortraker rockfish,30576,Most shortraker rockfish catches occurred in depths between 300 and 500 m in the Aleutian districts; few shortrakers were caught in the SBS. The highest CPUE and biomass estimates for this species came from the Central and Eastern AI. There was no clear relationship between shortraker length and depth of capture. Female and male length frequency distributions were similar through time with no clear trend in median length over the survey years.
Aleutian skate,472,"Aleutian skate were caught throughout the survey area and at all depths but were most frequently encountered at depths between 100 and 200 m in the Eastern AI and <100 m in the SBS. The highest estimated biomass of Aleutian skate occurred between 100–200 m in the SW Eastern AI and Eastern SBS as well as between 200 and 300 m in the E Western AI. Male and female Aleutian skates had a similar mode around 110 cm total length (T.L.) In the Eastern AI where Aleutian skates were most common, total lengths were similar across depths."
white blotched skate,480,"Although whiteblotched skates were caught throughout the AI and at all depths, they were caught most frequently at depths of 100–200 m in the Western and Eastern AI, and had a high estimated biomass across all depth strata in the Eastern AI. Male and female length frequencies both appear to be bimodal, with no consistent length differences between males and females across survey years. There were no strong patterns of total length with depth."
kamchatka flounder,10112,"Confident identification and separation of Kamchatka flounder from its close congener arrowtooth flounder on Aleutian surveys began in 1994. Kamchatka flounder were caught throughout the AI and at all depths, but were most frequently caught between 100–200 m in all survey districts. In the SBS, they were caught most frequently in the 1–100 m depth range but their estimated biomass was highest at 300–500 m. Lengths appear to be unimodal for both males and females. Size generally increased with depth. Females (median 41 cm F.L.) were slightly larger than males (37 cm F.L.), a pattern that has been consistent through time."
Southern rock sole,10262,"The identification and separation of southern rock sole from its close congener northern rock sole began on Aleutian surveys in 1996. Although southern rock sole were caught in all survey districts and at all depths shallower than 200 m, the highest estimated biomass was in the SBS at <100 m. The SBS had a larger estimated biomass than the other survey districts combined. As in previous years, the median length for females (37 cm F.L. in 2022) was larger than the median size for males (32 cm). There was no clear pattern of size with depth."
Pacific halibut,10120,Pacific halibut were caught in all depth ranges in the SBS and Eastern AI survey districts at 1–200 m. Males and females had comparable median lengths (females 55 cm F.L.; males 57 cm). Size distributions for both sexes were unimodal. Fork length increased with depth within each survey district and across the entire survey area.
Greenland turbot,10115,"Although Greenland turbot were caught in all of the survey districts, they were rare, encountered in only seven hauls during the entire survey, and occurred only in depths >200 m. The highest estimated biomass of Greenland turbot was at 300–500 m in the Eastern AI. Median lengths for females (81 cm F.L.) were slightly higher than for males (66 cm F.L.), although sample sizes are small and this pattern is not consistent over time in the AI survey. Length data were insufficient to detect changes in size with depth."
flathead sole,10130,"Although flathead sole were caught throughout the survey and at all depth ranges, they were caught most frequently in the Western AI at 100–200 m and the highest estimated biomass occurred in the SBS at 100–200 m. Females were slightly larger than males (31 cm F.L. compared to 29 cm F.L., in 2022); female flathead sole have historically been larger than males, and length distributions for both are unimodal. On average, the smallest individual flathead sole were caught between 100-200 m depth, with larger individuals at shallower (<100 m) and deeper (>200 m) depths."
rex sole,10200,"Although rex sole were caught throughout the survey area and at all depths, the highest estimated biomasses were at depths < 200 m. CPUE was particularly high in the SBS and Eastern AI. As in previous years, female rex sole were slightly larger than males (median 44 cm F.L. compared to median 41 cm F.L. in 2022), and the size distributions of both males and females were unimodal. There was no clear pattern of size with depth for rex sole in any of the survey districts or across the AI."
giant grenadier,21230,"No giant grenadier were caught in the SBS survey district, and with the exception of four tows in the 200–300 m depth range, they were only caught at depths deeper than 300 m. The largest catches were concentrated between Kiska and Kanaga Islands. Almost all recorded lengths were from females, which were much more abundant than males across the AI. Unlike all other species in this report whose length is either fork or total length, giant grenadier were measured from the tip of the snout to the insertion of the anal fin. There were insufficient length data to draw conclusions about changes in length with depth, or size differences between sexes."
northern rockfish,30420,"Northern rockfish were caught most frequently in the Western AI, with the highest biomasses estimated to be at 100–200 m in the Aleutian districts and 1–100 m in the SBS. The length frequencies of northern rockfishes were unimodal and symmetrical in 2022 for males and females, and females were slightly larger (33 cm median F.L. for females compared to 32 cm median F.L. for males). There were no strong patterns across depth except that the smallest individuals were found at depths <100 m."
shortspine thornyhead,30020,"Shortspine thornyhead were most frequently caught in the Western AI. The highest estimated biomasses were between 300–500 m in all survey districts except the Western AI, where they had large catches at all depths >100 m. Lengths collected for shortspine thornyhead in 2022 were not separated by sex for length frequencies; sex data were only collected in conjunction with otolith collections. Historically, males and females have had similar length distributions; in 2022 the median length for sexed otolith fish indicated slightly larger females (37 cm median F.L.) than males (34 cm median F.L.). On average, individuals caught in deeper hauls were slightly smaller."
Alaska skate,471,"Alaska skate were caught throughout the survey area. Length data have been insufficient to identify systematic differences in male and female size in the survey over time or changes in size with depth, though median female length has historically been higher than that of males."
great sculpin,21370,"Great sculpin were caught everywhere in the survey area, but only at depths <200 m. Historically females have been larger than males; in 2022 this pattern persisted (females median 68 cm F.L.; males 49 cm F.L.). There were no systematic patterns of great sculpin size with depth."
dusky rockfish,30152,Dusky rockfish were caught throughout the survey area and only at depths <300 m. Female and male dusky rockfish shared a similar median size of 40 cm F.L. There were insufficient data to identify trends in dusky rockfish size with depth.
dark rockfish,30151,"Dark rockfish were not caught in the Eastern AI or SBS. In the Western and Central AI, they were only caught at depths <200m. There were insufficient data to identify trends in size with depth, or systematic differences in fork length between the sexes."
leopard skate,477,"Leopard skates were caught everywhere in the survey area except the SBS, with small catches throughout and the largest catches occurring in the Western AI. There were insufficient data to identify trends in size with depth, or systematic differences in fork length between the sexes."
