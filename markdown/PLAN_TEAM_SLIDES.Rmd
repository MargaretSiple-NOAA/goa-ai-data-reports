## `r maxyr` `r SRVY` bottom trawl survey

The `r maxyr` `r SRVY` bottom trawl survey took place between `r dates_conducted`. The previous `r SRVY` survey was in `r compareyr`.

We surveyed **`r nstations`** stations in total, with a total of **`r nsuccessfulhauls`** successful hauls across the two survey vessels.

## Survey Purpose

To collect standardized and fishery-independent time series of:

-   Relative abundance
-   Distribution
-   Age and biological condition

There are `r nrow(report_species)` managed species or species groups in the Gulf of Alaska that have stock assessments.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Survey design

-   Stratified random survey
-   `r nstrata` strata defined by geography and depth zone
-   Station allocation based upon abundance, variance, survey area, and economic value
-   15 minute trawls (usually about 1.5 km distance)
-   *Poly Nor 'Eastern* net with rollers & bobbins

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Data status

-   `r SRVY` data are finalized as of **September 11th**
-   Age composition will be updated as Age & Growth finish otolith samples
-   CPUE tables will be available on FOSS in the future
-   Collaboration with SMART group to improve data pull and processing steps
