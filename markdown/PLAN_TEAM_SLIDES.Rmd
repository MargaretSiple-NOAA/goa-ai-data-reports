## `r maxyr` `r SRVY` bottom trawl survey

The `r maxyr` `r SRVY` bottom trawl survey took place between `r dates_conducted`. The previous `r SRVY` survey was in `r compareyr`.

We surveyed **`r nstations`** stations in total, with a total of **`r nsuccessfulhauls`** successful hauls across the two survey vessels.

:::notes
This is the second year we have instituted some important changes to our survey in an attempt to slow the work pace and reduce the repetitive motion injuries that have been on the rise in recent years.

## Survey charter vessels

:::::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
### F/V Alaska Provider

2013-2016, 2021-Present

7 yrs of charter experience

Cpt Loren Reynolds, ~28 yrs experience
:::

::: {.column}
### F/V Ocean Explorer

2010-2012, 2017-present

9 yrs of charter experience

Cpt Dan Carney, ~9 yrs experience
:::
::::::

:::notes
Both of our charter vessels have conducted the Aleutian survey several times and our skippers are highly experienced, hard bottom draggers

Their experience is crucial to the success of this survey.

## Survey purpose

To collect standardized and fishery-independent time series of:

-   Relative abundance
-   Distribution
-   Age and biological condition

There are `r nrow(report_species)` managed species or species groups in the Gulf of Alaska that are presented here.

:::notes
The purpose of our survey is to assess the status of groundfish and invertebrate populations in the Gulf of Alaskaby describing their distribution and abundance along with the length and age composition of the populations
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Survey design

-   Stratified random survey
-   `r nstrata` strata defined by geography and depth zone
-   Station allocation based upon abundance, variance, survey area, and economic value
-   15 minute trawls (usually about 1.5 km distance)
-   *Poly Nor 'Eastern* net with rollers & bobbins


:::notes
Our survey is a stratified random design that allocates stations to strata based on abundance, variance, stratum area, and economic value
The strata are primarily based on depth and extend down to 500m; strata are further divided by geography and statistical sampling areas
We randomly allocate stations within this design framework from a pool of previously successfully trawled locations
This year, we pre-assigned XX% of the total XXX stations allocated as “new” meaning the each vessel had to trawl around a dozen previously untrawled stations last summer
and this will become a permanent feature of our station allocations in the future

## Data status

-   `r SRVY` data are finalized as of **September 11th**
-   Age composition will be updated as Age & Growth finish otolith samples
-   CPUE tables will be available on FOSS
-   Collaboration with SMART group to improve data pull and processing steps

:::notes
For the first time, this year we’ve finalized our survey data prior to the September Plan Team meetings and design based estimates along with length composition tables are now available in RACEBase in Oracle
We achieved this through some important innovations (like in season data editing) and a lot of hard work by our Survey Team
Our CPUE and Effort data will be made available on FOSS, the NMFS Fishery One Stop Shop for data and will also be available as previously on AKFIN
Links for both of these web-based servers are at the bottom of this slide

## Collections

:::notes
Now for a quick summary of our collections
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Species lengths collected

:::notes
For the 20 species included in this summary, we collected more than XXXX lengths and a total of around XXXXX lengths collected overall
One of the changes we instituted this summer to reduce ergonomic strain was based on a stock assessment - survey team collaboration who determined that we could reduce the number of lengths per species and the number of sexed lengths measured
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Species otoliths collected

:::notes
We also collected almost 8000 pairs of otoliths this summer from 16 groundfish species and this number was on par with other recent surveys
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Other projects and special collections

:::notes
As usual, we had a wide variety of other projects and special collections on our survey

All of the typical projects were represented: IPHC halibut otolith collection, ES60 acoustic backscatter, water column light levels, and Feeding Habits collections

Highlighting a couple of the Special Projects - INSERT SPECIAL COLLECTIONS TO MENTION HERE

## Automated data reports

![Flow of new automated data reports](../img/DataReportFlowChart.png)
In progress at the AFSC GAP products [GitHub page](https://www.github.com/afsc-gap-products/goa-ai-data-reports/).

## Catch composition

```{r catchcomp}
p2
```

:::notes
Overall species composition in 2023 was similar to past years with arrowtooth flounder and POP dominating the catches.
Total biomass for these taxa appears to be slightly higher than during the last couple of GOA surveys
:::

## Bottom temperature (°C)

```{r bottomtemp}
{list_temperature[[1]]}
```

:::notes
Water temperatures measured at the trawl net this summer remain above the long term average at both the bottom and the surface

This plot shows the full distribution of observed bottom temperatures in the survey. The heat colors show the quantiles of the distribution, and the shaded area is the shape of the full distribution.
:::

## Surface temperature (°C)

```{r surfacetemp}
{list_temperature[[2]]}
```

## Biomass trends

:::notes
Now we’ll take a look at biomass trends, length frequencies, and distribution & abundance for several species

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
# NEED TO ADD HERE: CHECKS IF THINGS ARE LOADED INTO ENV AND LOAD THEM IF NOT
# report_species contains the list of species in the report
