```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

# Setup channel to connect to Oracle --------------------------------------
source("R/setup_channel.R")
# The setup_channel.R script sets up a channel using your Oracle username and pw.

# Which survey number is it?
(survnumber)
survnumber_sql <- RODBC::sqlQuery(channel, "select count(distinct cruise) survnumber
from race_data.cruises a, race_data.survey_definitions b, race_data.surveys c
where b.survey_name = 'Aleutian Islands Bottom Trawl Survey'
and a.survey_id = c.survey_id
and b.survey_definition_id = c.survey_definition_id")

# What is the number of successfully sampled stations?
(nstations)
nstations_sql <- RODBC::sqlQuery(channel, "select count(distinct hauljoin) nstations
from racebase.haul
where region = 'AI'
and cruise = 202201
and abundance_haul = 'Y'")

```



## Checks

This script produces an easy-to-read table that compares the values produced in R to the ones produced by SQL queries, which used to be used to produce the data reports. 

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
