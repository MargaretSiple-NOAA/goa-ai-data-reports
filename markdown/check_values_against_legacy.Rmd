## Checks

This script produces an easy-to-read table that compares the values produced in R to the ones produced by SQL queries, which used to be used to produce the data reports. 

```{r}
indiv_values <- data.frame("Variable name" = c("survnumber","nstations"),
                           "Description" = c("description 1","description 2")) %>%
  "Value in previous report year" = c(NA,NA),
"Value this year from R" = c(survnumber,nstations)
  kableExtra::kable()
```
